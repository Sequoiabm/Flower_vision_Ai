Flower Viewer AI - Binary Classification with Neural Networks


Welcome to the Flower Viewer AI project, a binary classification model that utilizes neural networks and deep learning techniques to classify images of flowers. 
Developed by Sequoia Boubion-McKay in 2024.

Model Summary
Accuracy: 81.04% (Impressive!)
Training Loss: 0.242377
Architecture: Two hidden dense layers in the neural network

Technologies Used
PyTorch: Deep learning framework for building and training the neural network.
Seaborn: Data visualization library for creating insightful plots.
Matplotlib/Numpy: Essential libraries for data visualization and manipulation.

Hardware Specifications
Hardware: 2023 MacBook Pro with M2 Pro Chip and 32GB RAM.
Usage


IMPORTANT:
Running this code locally requires substantial hardware capabilities due to heavy machine learning tasks. 
It's highly recommended to use a cloud-based platform like Google Colab to run this notebook efficiently.

Dataset
The model was trained using the Flowers Dataset, which contains a diverse collection of flower images.
